	// - "The no-cache response directive indicates that the response can be stored in caches, but must be validated with the origin server before each reuse â€” even when the cache is disconnected from the origin server."
	// - "The private response directive indicates that the response can be stored only in a private cache (e.g. local caches in browsers).""
	// - "max-age=0 is a workaround for no-cache, because many old (HTTP/1.0) cache implementations don't support no-cache."
	cacheControl: "no-cache, private, max-age=0",

	// "The Expires HTTP header contains the date/time after which the response is considered expired.
	// Invalid expiration dates with value 0 represent a date in the past and mean that the resource is already expired."
	"Expires": time.Unix(0, 0).UTC().Format(time.RFC1123),

	// "The Pragma HTTP/1.0 general header is an implementation-specific header that may have various effects along the request-response chain. This header serves for backwards compatibility with the HTTP/1.0 caches that do not have a Cache-Control HTTP/1.1 header."
	// If set to 'no-cache':
	// "Same as Cache-Control: no-cache. Forces caches to submit the request to the origin server for validation before a cached copy is released"
